# Double-Pass Assembler for Imaginary Computer

This repository contains the final project for the System Programming course at The Open University of Israel. It is a double-pass assembler implemented in C, tailored for an imaginary computer architecture.

## Features

- **Double-Pass Assembly Process:** Efficient translation of assembly code through a two-pass approach.
- **Written in C:** Implemented in C for portability and ease of understanding.
- **Imaginary Computer Architecture:** Designed to assemble programs for an imaginary computer architecture.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wh1ter0seunm4skedX/Double-Pass-Assembler-for-Imaginary-Computer-System-Programming-Project.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Assembler:**
   Compile the assembler using a C compiler such as gcc.
   ```bash
   gcc -o assembler main.c
   ```

3. **Provide Assembly Code:**
   Provide your assembly code files as input to the assembler.

4. **Execute the Assembler:**
   Execute the assembler to generate the corresponding machine code.
   ```bash
   ./assembler input.asm output.obj
   ```
